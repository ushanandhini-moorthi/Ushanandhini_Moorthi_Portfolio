        <p>This section provides answers to the most common questions you have as a new user when starting with AWS.</p>
        <p><b>Do I need a credit card to sign up for AWS?</b>
        </p>
        <p>Yes. AWS requires a valid credit or debit card for identity verification and billing, even if you only use Free Tier services.</p>
        <p><b>Is enabling MFA mandatory?</b>
        </p>
        <p>No, but AWS strongly recommends enabling MFA for the Root user and all IAM users with console access.</p>
        <p><b>Can I change or delete IAM usernames?</b>
        </p>
        <p>No, IAM usernames cannot be changed once created.</p>
