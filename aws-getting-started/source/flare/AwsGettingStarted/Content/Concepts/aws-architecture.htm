        <h3><b>AWS High-Level Architecture</b>
        </h3>
        <p>This topic explains the high-level architecture of AWS and how users securely access core cloud services.</p>
        <p>.<img src="../Resources/Images/amazon imager.jpg" /></p>
        <p>Users connect to AWS through the internet into a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Within the VPC, services such as Amazon EC2 provide compute capacity, Amazon S3 stores data, and Amazon RDS manages databases. Security controls and network boundaries ensure that resources are isolated and protected.</p>
