## Topic-Based Authoring Summary

These samples demonstrate my understanding of topic-based authoring by separating Concept and Task content to match user intent and improve clarity, reuse, and maintainability in cloud-native documentation.

## Conclusion

The attached samples reflect my understanding of topic-based authoring as a method for structuring technical documentation around user intent. By separating **Concept** topics from **Task** topics, I aimed to ensure that readers can first build the necessary mental model of a system and then follow clear, actionable procedures to accomplish specific goals.

The Concept sample focuses on explaining background, purpose, and relationships, while the Task sample concentrates on prerequisites, ordered steps, and expected results. Together, they demonstrate how modular documentation improves clarity, reuse, and maintainability—especially in cloud-native and observability platforms where users frequently switch between learning how systems work and configuring them in practice.

These examples are included in my portfolio to showcase my ability to apply structured writing principles and to design documentation that supports both understanding and execution for technical audiences.
